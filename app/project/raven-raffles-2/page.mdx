Raven Raffles is a product of Raven Restocks. I was the one in charge to develop it from ground up to production.

Why people really want it? Because we could resell the sneakers with a BIG margin of profit, and sneakers has its own market - people will buy it.

## Solution

Because it is VERY hard to win raffle. In order to win this Raffle, or at least have advantages on chances to win than others. We could join multiple times with multiple identity, payment methods, and etc.
