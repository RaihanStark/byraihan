## Introduction

In response to the growing popularity of AI technology, especially after the release of OpenAI's GPT, I set out to develop a simple AI web aggregator platform. My goal is to make it easier for people to find and learn about various AI solutions available today.

## Background

As AI technology becomes more prevalent, so does the number of AI-based SaaS products. However, with so many options, it can be challenging to find the right AI tools for specific needs. My project aims to solve this problem by creating a website where users can easily discover and explore different AI solutions.

The AI landscape has exploded with thousands of new tools, each claiming to revolutionize different aspects of work and life. This creates an overwhelming paradox of choice for users who need specific solutions but don't know where to start looking.

## Objectives

My main goals for this project are:

- **Creating a comprehensive database** of AI solutions from different websites
- **Designing a website** that's easy to use and navigate
- **Categorizing AI tools** by use case, industry, and functionality
- **Providing detailed information** about each tool including pricing, features, and user reviews
- **Building a community** where users can share experiences and recommendations
- **Implementing search and filter** capabilities for precise tool discovery

## Key Features

### AI Tools Database
- Comprehensive collection of AI tools and services
- Regular updates with new AI solutions
- Detailed information for each tool
- User ratings and reviews

### Advanced Search & Discovery
- Search by name, category, or use case
- Filter by pricing, features, and ratings
- AI-powered recommendations
- Trending and popular tools section

### User Features
- Save favorite AI tools
- Create custom collections
- Newsletter subscription for updates
- User accounts and profiles

### Content & Resources
- AI news and updates
- Tool comparisons and reviews
- Use case guides and tutorials
- Industry insights and trends

## Challenges

While working on this project, I encountered several challenges:

### Data Collection
- **Web scraping complexities**: Gathering data from various websites with different structures
- **Data accuracy**: Ensuring information stays current and accurate
- **API limitations**: Working within rate limits of various services

### Competition & Market Position
- **Established competitors**: Competing with well-funded aggregator platforms
- **Differentiation**: Finding unique value propositions
- **User acquisition**: Building initial user base and trust

### Technical Challenges
- **Scalability**: Designing database to handle growing number of tools
- **Performance**: Optimizing search and filter operations
- **Data management**: Keeping information updated and relevant

### Business Model
- **Monetization strategy**: Balancing free access with revenue generation
- **Partnerships**: Building relationships with AI tool providers
- **Sustainability**: Creating a viable long-term business model

## Current Status
