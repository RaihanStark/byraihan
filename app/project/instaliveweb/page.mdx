## Introduction

An Instagram Live Third-Party Platform to provides you with a RTMP server and stream key for streaming using software like OBS-Studio.

## Problems

Instagram did not provide RTMP for user to stream outside Instagram Client. This limitation prevented content creators from:
- Using professional streaming software
- Streaming from desktop computers
- Utilizing advanced streaming features like overlays, multiple cameras, and screen sharing
- Managing live comments and viewers from a central dashboard

## Solution

We reverse engineered the Instagram API to get the RTMP from the Instagram Server, and we created a dashboard for it so user can easily use and manage it. This solution enables professional content creators to leverage their existing streaming setup while reaching their Instagram audience.

## Key Features

### Streaming Capabilities
- **RTMP Server Generation**: Automatically generates RTMP server URL and stream key
- **OBS Integration**: Seamless integration with OBS-Studio and other streaming software
- **Broadcast Control**: Start and stop broadcasts directly from the dashboard

### Live Management
- **Live Comments**: Real-time display of viewer comments
- **Live Viewers**: Track current viewer count and engagement
- **Instagram Login**: Secure authentication with your Instagram account
- **OTP Handler**: Automatic handling of Instagram's two-factor authentication

### User Experience
- **Intuitive Dashboard**: Clean and easy-to-use interface
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates for comments and viewer metrics
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **Flask-WTF** - Form handling and validation
- **Flask-Session** - Session management

### Frontend
- **JavaScript** - Client-side functionality
- **HTML/SCSS** - Markup and styling
- **jQuery** - DOM manipulation
- **Ajax** - Asynchronous requests

### Infrastructure
- **Heroku** - Cloud hosting platform
- **Instagram Private API** - Reverse-engineered Instagram endpoints

## Technical Implementation

The project involved several technical challenges:

1. **API Reverse Engineering**: Carefully analyzing Instagram's private API to understand RTMP stream generation
2. **Authentication Flow**: Implementing secure Instagram login with OTP support
3. **Real-time Communication**: Building WebSocket connections for live comments and viewer updates
4. **Stream Management**: Handling RTMP server allocation and stream lifecycle
