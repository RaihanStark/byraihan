## My Timeline Experience

### Registration  (12 July 2025)

The registration was straightforward, the KYC process was quick and the account was verified in less than 24 hours (Under 10-15 minutes).

### First Transaction Test (12 July 2025)

![Second Transaction](/images/acctual-com-honest-review/transaction-2.png)

I was able to send a few payment from USDC to USDC through flexble payment option. The process was quick and the funds were available in less than 10 minutes. It seems everything is automated.

So far no problem with Crypto to Crypto transfer after three transactions.

### Trying ACH to Crypto Transfer (18 July 2025)

I tried to receive a payment from my client business bank account (New York) to my USDC (Ethereum) wallet.

The system picked up the payment immediately but there is processing time.

They claims that the processing time is take up to 90 minutes. It's not true in my case. I thought the delay is probably because three-days ach settlement.

### Follow Up (19 July 2025)

![support](/images/acctual-com-honest-review/support.png)

I asked them about the processing time and they didn't answer or even reply a single message. This is pretty big red-flag for financial technology company to be not responsive with the support. 

That will caused a lot of problems for the users since it involved their money and people want to know where their money goes.

### Another Follow Up (21 July 2025)
I thought, okay, I will wait because it is the weekend and maybe the bank is closed, so they need more time to process the payment. I decided to check again on Monday. I also sent an email to support@acctual.com to follow up.

EDIT: July 25, 2025 

Never heard back from them.

### Follow Up CEO (22 July 2025)

![ceo](/images/acctual-com-honest-review/ceo.png)

I sent an email to CEO of Acctual (Atikh Bana). I asked him about the processing time and He replied that he will check it and get back to me.

That's relieving to hear from the CEO.

### 8 Days Later (5 Business Days) (25 July 2025)

![ceo](/images/acctual-com-honest-review/ceo-2.png)

I still haven't received the payment nor heard back from them. The CEO has not replied to my email.


### What's Happening? 

I don't really understand what is going on because there is no reply from the CEO or the support team. It's disappointing, since the company could be great, but they are not meeting expectations.

My client is using a business account from Chase Bank in New York. I have already passed KYC, and my Ethereum wallet is verified on big exchanges like Binance, Pintu, and Pionex.

There is nothing wrong with the transaction. There has never been any money laundering or illegal activity from either side. The ACH settlement should not be a problem because it has already been 5 business days.

![FAQ](/images/acctual-com-honest-review/image.png)

They told us that non-US residents cannot receive ACH (Person to Person) payments above $2000. However, my client is using a business account, and even if it was considered a person-to-person transfer, the amount is only $1860, so it should not be a problem.


## Conclusion

I'm still waiting from my payment. I will update this post if I receive the payment or further more information.
